# Study Flash Card Game

## Usage
Please start with the "start_page.py" file. The game will open a window and it will lead to the main game page. There will be two words shown in the game and a point counter. One word is an English word and the other is its Turkish meaning. Some meanings in Turkish are put incorrectly, which means that there are incorrect answers in the game.
Your job is to use right or wrong buttons to mark whether if the meaning of the words are correct or not. Every right answer you have gets you 25 points and every incorrect answers remove 10 points from your final marks. Then finally getting every answer correctly (know that the second time shown cards will not get you any points or remove) you will be led to the leaderboard page and check if your points are enough to be in the leaderboard page. You will then choose a name for it to be shown in the leaderboard. Please be sure to choose a different name each time.
After that, you can play the game again by clicking to replay button on the leaderboard page and play with the incorrect answers to furtherly exercise. You can always run "try_again.py" to play the last incorrect words or on the start page you can choose to play again.
